Start 
    declare variables for inputs, total, max, min, average, interest, interest rate

    set total to 0
    set max to smallest possible value (Double.MIN_VALUE) to avoid errors
    set min to largest possible value (Double.MAX_VALUE) to avoid errors
    set interest rate to 20%

    while loop (to get 5 inputs)
        Prompt for user input
        Read input

        Store input in appropriate variables

        Add inputs to total

        If input is more than max, update max
        If input is less than min, update min

    End while loop

    Calculate average by dividing by number of inputs
    Calculate interest of total by multiplying by interest rate
    
    Output stored input for verification
    Output total
    Output average
    Output maximum
    Output minimum
    Output interest
